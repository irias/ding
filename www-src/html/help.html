		<h2>Ding</h2>
		<p>Ding builds your software projects, producing programs you can then use in other systems to deploy.</p>
		<p>The following concepts play a role in ding:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Repositories</li>
			<li>Builds</li>
			<li>Results</li>
			<li>Releases</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Repositories</h3>
		<p>Ding assumes a software project is in a version control system. Ding currently only supports git. On each build, ding clones the git repository. Per ding repository, you need to configure a shell script <tt>build.sh</tt>. It must compile the software, run tests, create releasable results.</p>
		<p>A repository exists so you can create execute <em>builds</em>.</p>

		<h3>Builds</h3>
		<p>A build is an attempt to compile the software and create releasable results. A build runs through (hopefully all) of the following steps:</p>

		<h4>new</h4>
		<p>Waiting to be started: we only run 1 concurrent build per repository, regardless of branch.</p>

		<h4>clone</h4>
		<p>Fetching source code. Ding calls the external programs git, or hg (for mercurial). If you specify <tt>origin</tt> URLs that make use of SSH, you will probably also need to install ssh keys in $HOME/.ssh for the unix user Ding is running under. In that case, make sure sure the private key file is only accessible by the user (not group) ding is running under.</p>

		<h4>build</h4>
		<p>Executes your build.sh script. If you need resources such as a database, you could configure that before hand. Ding always runs at most 1 concurrent build per repository, so builds won't overwrite each other's data during a build. If you want to keep data in the database after a build is finished, you currently have two options: 1. Make a backup/dump of the database. 2. Dynamically create a database as part of the build script.</p>

		<h4>success</h4>
		<p>Successful builds should have results that can be released.</p>

		<p>Builds are automatically cleaned up to reclaim disk space. Only the last build per branch and released builds are never deleted. Unreleased builds can also have just their build directory removed to reclaim space. Those builds exist in the database, but cannot be opened to see details.</p>

		<p>The goal of a build is to create <em>results</em>.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Results are just files that can be released. For Java projects, they are typically jar files. For Go projects, they are typically binary files, one for each architecture you compiled for. The output of your build.sh scripts points to the files that are results. Results only exist in the build directory and are removed when the build is removed.</p>
		<p>But you can also <em>release</em> results.</p>

		<h3>Releases</h3>
		<p>Releases are builds of which the results have been saved outside the build directory, including the build script and output captured during the build. The build directory can then be cleaned.</p>

		<h2>API</h2>
		<p>Ding has an API at <a href="/ding/">/ding/</a>.</p>

		<h2>Example build.sh scripts</h2>
		<p>Build scripts will vary over projects. Nevertheless, some examples for inspiration:</p>

		<h3>Ding, written in Go</h3>
		<p>For Go projects, it is helpful to have them checked out in a path that starts with <tt>src/</tt>, so you can easily configure a private $GOPATH. This assumes you've configured $TOOLCHAINS through Ding's config.json, and extracted the Go version of your choice under $TOOLCHAINS/go.</p>
		<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
#!/bin/bash
set -e

export GOPATH=$BUILDDIR/checkout
export PATH=$PATH:$TOOLCHAINS/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin

mkdir local &&
cat &gt;local/config-test.json &lt;&lt;EOF &&
... a config as shown in INSTALL.md ...
EOF

(cd vendor/bitbucket.org/mjl/sherpa/cmd/sherpadoc && go install) &&
mkdir -p node_modules/.bin && ln -s $(which jshint) node_modules/.bin/ &&
make build test release</pre>

		<h3>Sherpa-servlet-example, written in Java</h3>
		<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
#!/bin/bash
set -e

VERSION=$(sed -n 's/^.*&lt;version&gt;\(.*\)&lt;\/version&gt;.*/\1/p' pom.xml  | head -n1)

mvn -B install
echo release: sherpa-servlet-example.jar $VERSION any any `javac -version 2&gt;&1 | cut -f2 -d' '` target/SherpaServletExample-$VERSION.jar</pre>

		<h2>File hierarchy</h2>
		<p>For the curious, this is how files are layed out by Ding:</p>
		<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
data/
    build/&lt;repoName&gt;/&lt;buildID&gt;/  ($BUILDDIR during builds)
        checkout/$CHECKOUTPATH/  (working directory for build.sh)
        scripts/
            build.sh             (copied from database before build)
        output/
            {clone,build}.{stdout,stderr,output,nsec}
        home/                    ($HOME during builds)
    release/&lt;repoName&gt;/&lt;buildId&gt;/
        &lt;result-filename&gt;
</pre>
